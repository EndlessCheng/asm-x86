  The Intel386 Processor (1985)
  The Intel386 processor was the first 32-bit processor in the IA-32 architecture family. It introduced 32-bit registers for use both to hold operands and for addressing. The lower half of each 32-bit Intel386 register retains the properties of the 16-bit registers of earlier generations, permitting backward compatibility. The processor also provides a virtual-8086 mode that allows for even greater efficiency when executing programs created for 8086/8088 processors.    [END]
